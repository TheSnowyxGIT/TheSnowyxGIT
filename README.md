## Hi there, I'm Adrien! 👋

### 🚀 About Me

I embarked on the developer journey as a self-taught enthusiast at the age of 14. Throughout my computer engineering adventure, I've had the privilege of crafting DevOps tools used by a dedicated SAP team and mentoring the next generation of developers at EPITA. Passionate about bridging tech gaps, I thrive in environments where I can make a difference with code.
